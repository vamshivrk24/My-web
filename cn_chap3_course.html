		<h2>TCP/IP</h2>

      <p><br><br>
	•	The <b>TCP/IP model</b> explains how the protocol suite works to provide communications<br>
		It has Four layers: Application, Transport, Internetwork, and Network Interface<br>
		<p><img src="images/TCP_IP.gif" title="TCP/IP Model"></p>
	•	Application Layer:<br>
		-File Transfer Protocol (FTP)<br>
		-Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)<br>
		-Network File System (NFS)<br>
		-Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)<br>
		-Terminal emulation protocol (telnet)<br>
		-Remote login application (rlogin)<br>
		-Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)<br>
		-Domain Name System (DNS)<br>
		-Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br><br>
	•	Transport Layer:<br>
		Performs end-to-end packet delivery, reliability, and flow control<br>
		Protocols:<br>
		-TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communications between two hosts<br>
		-Requires more network overhead<br>
		-UDP provides connectionless datagram services between two hosts<br>
		-Faster but less reliable<br>
		-Reliability is left to the Application layer<br>
		Ports:<br>
		-TCP and UDP use port numbers for communications between hosts<br>
		-Port numbers are divided into three ranges:<br>
		-Well Known Ports are those from 1 through 1,023<br>
		-Registered Ports are those from 1,024 through 49,151<br>
		-Dynamic/Private Ports are those from 49,152 through 65,535<br>
		TCP sliding windows:<br>
		-Control the flow and efficiency of communication<br>
		-Also known as windowing<br>
		-A method of controlling packet flow between hosts<br>
		-Allows multiple packets to be sent and affirmed with a single acknowledgement packet<br>
		-The size of the TCP window determines the number of acknowledgements sent for a given data transfer<br>
		-Networks that perform large data transfers should use large window sizes<br><br>
	•	Internetwork Layer:<br>
		Four main protocols function at this layer<br>
		-Internet Protocol (IP)<br>
		-Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)<br>
		-Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)<br>
		-Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)<br>
		ARP:<br>
		A routed protocol<br>
		Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses<br>
		ARP tables contain the MAC and IP addresses of other devices on the network<br>
		Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP):<br>
		Similar to ARP<br>
		Used primarily by diskless workstations<br>
		Which have MAC addresses burned into their network cards but no IP addresses<br>
		Client’s IP configuration is stored on a RARP server<br><br>
	•	Network Interface Layer:<br>
		-Plays the same role as the Data Link and Physical layers of the OSI model<br>
		-The MAC address, network card drivers, and specific interfaces for the network card function at this level<br>
		-No specific IP functions exist at this layer<br>
		-Because the layer’s focus is on communication with the network card and other networking hardware<br><br>
	•	The Cisco Three-Layer Hierarchical Model:<br>
		Does not describe how communications take place<br>
		Focuses on how best to design a network<br>
		Especially a relatively large network or one that is expected to grow<br>
		Each layer of the model is involved in specific functions<br>
		Is typically defined by a particular type of device<br>
		The three layers of the model from bottom up are Access, Distribution, and Core<br><br>
