       	<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
		<h2>Network Devices</h2>

      <p><br><br>
	•	Repeaters:<br>
		The number of nodes on a network and the length of cable used influence the quality of communication on the network.<br>
		Attenuation: The degradation of signal clarity.<br>
		<b>Repeaters</b> work against attenuation by repeating signals that they receive on a network, typically cleaning and regenerating the digital transmission in the process.<br>
	•	Hubs:<br>
		A <b>Hub</b> is a generic connection device used to tie several networking cables together to create a link between different stations on a network.<br>
		<b>Active hubs</b> amplify or repeat signals that pass through them.<br>
		<b>Passive hub</b> merely connects cables on a network and provides no signal regeneration.<br>
		<b>Topology</b> refers to the physical layout of network cable and devices.<br>
		<b>Advantages</b><br>
		-Can extend a network’s total distance<br>
		-Do not seriously affect network performance<br>
		-Certain repeaters can connect networks using different physical media<br>
		<b>Disadvantages</b><br>
		-Cannot connect different network architectures, such as Token Ring and Ethernet<br>
		-Do not reduce network traffic<br>
		-They repeat everything they receive<br>
		-Do not segment the network<br>
		-Do not reformat data structures<br>
	•	Wireless Network Components:<br>
		In "Ad hoc mode"-<br> 
		Wireless clients can connect and communicate directly with each other & there is no access point.<br>
		In "Infrastructure mode"-<br>
		Wireless clients attach wirelessly to an access point which involves the access point wired back into a switch.<br>
		Basic Service Set (BSS)-<br>
		When a single access point is available in infrastructure mode.<br>
		Extended Service Set (ESS)-<br>
		Involve multiple access points connected to various switches in the network.<br>
	•	Network Segmentation:<br>
		<b>Segmentation</b> is the breaking down of a single heavily populated network segment into smaller segments, or collision domains, populated by fewer nodes.<br>
		<b>Segment</b> is part of a network that is divided logically or physically from the rest of the network.<br>
		When network administrators place too many nodes on the same network segment it causes the number of collisions to increase.<br>
	•	Bridges:<br>
		-Operate at the Data Link layer of the OSI model.<br>
		-Filter traffic between network segments by examining the destination MAC address.<br>
		-Based on the destination MAC address, the bridge either forwards or discards the frame.<br>
		-Reduce network traffic by keeping local traffic on the local segment.<br>
		<b>Advantages</b><br>
		-Can extend a network by acting as a repeater<br>
		-Can reduce network traffic on a segment by subdividing network communications<br>
		-Increase the available bandwidth to individual nodes because fewer nodes share a collision domain<br>
		-Reduce collisions<br>
		-Some bridges connect networks using different media types and architectures<br>
		<b>Disadvantages</b><br>
		-Slower than repeaters and hubs<br>
		-Extra processing by viewing MAC addresses<br>
		-Forward broadcast frames indiscriminately, so they do not filter broadcast traffic<br>
		-More expensive than repeaters and hubs<br>
		<b>Broadcast storm</b><br>
		-When two or more stations engage in the transmission of excessive broadcast traffic<br>
	•	Switches:<br>
		<b>Switches</b> operates at the Data Link layer of the OSI model<br>
		Increase network performance by reducing the number of frames transmitted to the rest of the network<br>
		Switch opens a virtual circuit between the source and the destination<br>
		Prevents communications between just two computers from being broadcast to every computer on the network or segment called <b>microsegmentation</b>.<br>
		<b>Advantages</b><br>
		-Switches increase available network bandwidth<br>
		-Switches reduce the workload on individual computers<br>
		-Switches increase network performance<br>
		-Networks that include switches experience fewer frame collisions because switches create collision domains for each connection (a process called microsegmentation)<br>
		-Switches connect directly to workstations<br>
		<b>Disadvantages</b><br>
		-Switches are significantly more expensive than bridges<br>
		-Network connectivity problems can be difficult to trace through a switch<br>
		-Broadcast traffic may be troublesome<br>
	•	Routers:<br>
		<b>Routers</b> operates at the Network layer of the OSI model.<br>
		They provide filtering and network traffic control on LANs and WANs and can connect multiple segments and multiple networks<br>
		<b>Internetworks</b><br>
		-Networks connected by multiple routers<br>
		-Similar to switches and bridges in that they segment a network and filter traffic<br>
		-Routers use the logical address<br>
		<b>Advantages</b><br>
		-Can connect different network architectures, such as Ethernet and Token Ring<br>
		-Can choose the best path across an internetwork using dynamic routing techniques<br>
		-Reduce network traffic by creating collision domains<br>
		-Reduce network traffic by creating broadcast domains<br>
		<b>Disadvantages</b><br>
		-Routers work only with routable network protocols; most but not all protocols are routable<br>
		-Routers are more expensive than other devices<br>
		-Dynamic router communications (inter-router communication) cause additional network overhead, which results in less bandwidth for user data<br>
		-Routers are slower than other devices because they must analyze a data transmission from the Physical through the Network layer<br>
	•	Gateway:<br>
		-Usually a combination of hardware and software<br>
		-Translates between different protocol suites<br>
		-Has the most negative effect on network performance<br>
		-Packets must be rebuilt not just at the lower levels but at the very upper levels<br>
		-So that actual data content can be converted into a format the destination can process<br>
		-Creates the most latency<br>
	•	Half-duplex communications<br>
		Devices can send and receive signals, but not at the same time<br>
	•	Full-duplex communications<br>
		Devices can send and receive signals simultaneously<br>
		Most Ethernet networks can use equipment that supports half- and full-duplex communications<br>
		Full-duplex communications use one set of wires to send and a separate set to receive<br>
