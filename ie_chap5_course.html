		<h2>Introduction to the JavaScript</h2>

      <p><br><br>
		<p>JavaScript<br>
		• Scripting language which is used to enhance the functionality and appearance of web pages.<br>
		• Before you can run code examples with JavaScript on your computer, you may need to change your browser's security settings.<br>
		• IE9 prevents scripts on the local computer from running by default<br>
		• Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari (including on the iPhone) and the Android browser have JavaScript enabled by default.<br>
		• All major web browsers contain JavaScript interpreters, which process the commands written in JavaScript.<br><br>
		Spacing displayed by a browser in a web page is determined by the HTML5 elements used to format the page<br>
		• Often, JavaScripts appear in the < head > section of the HTML5 document<br>
		• The browser interprets the contents of the < head > section first<br>
		• The < script > tag indicates to the browser that the text that follows is part of a script. Attribute type specifies the scripting language used in the script-such as text/javascript<br><br>
		The script Element and Commenting Your Scripts<br>
		• The < script > tag indicates to the browser that the text which follows is part of a script.<br>
		• The type attribute specifies the MIME type of the script as well as the scripting language used in the script-in this case, a text file written in javascript.<br>
		• In HTML5, the default MIME type for a < script > is "text/html", so you can omit the type attribute from your < script > tags.<br>
		• You'll see it in legacy HTML documents with embedded JavaScripts.</p><br>
		<p>The parentheses following the name of a method contain the arguments that the method requires to perform its task (or its action)<br>
		• Every statement should end with a semicolon (also known as the statement terminator), although none is required by JavaScript<br>
		• JavaScript is case sensitive<br>
		• Not using the proper uppercase and lowercase letters is a syntax error</p><br>
		<p>Modifying your Scripts<br>
		The + operator (called the "concatenation operator" when used in this manner) join two strings together</p><br>
		<p>Dialogs<br>
		• Useful to display information in windows that "pop up" on the screen to grab the user's attention<br>
		• Typically used to display important messages to the user browsing the web page<br>
		• Browser's window object uses method alert to display an alert dialog<br>
		• Method alert requires as its argument the string to be displayed</p><br>
		<p>Escape Sequences<br>
		When a backslash is encountered in a string of characters, the next character is combined with the backslash to form an escape sequence. The escape sequence \n is the newline character. It causes the cursor in the HTML5 document to move to the beginning of the next line.</p><br>
		<p>Scripting<br>
		<p>Gives you the ability to generate part or all of a web page's content at the time it is shown to the user. Such web pages are said to be dynamic, as opposed to static, since their content has the ability to change<br>
		Keywords are words with special meaning in JavaScript<br>
		<b>Keyword var</b><br>
		•Used to declare the names of variables<br>
		• A variable is a location in the computer's memory where a value can be stored for use by a script<br>
		• All variables have a name, type and value, and should be declared with a var statement before they are used in a script<br>
		• A variable name can be any valid identifier consisting of letters, digits, underscores ( _ ) and dollar signs ($) that does not begin with a digit and is not a reserved JavaScript keyword.<br>
		A variable is assigned a value with an assignment statement, using the assignment operator, =.<br>
		• The = operator is called a binary operator, because it has two operands.<br>
		null keyword<br>
		• Signifies that a variable has no value<br>
		• null is not a string literal, but rather a predefined term indicating the absence of value<br>
		• Writing a null value to the document, however, displays the word "null"</p><br>
		<p>Memory Concepts<br>
		Variable names correspond to locations in the computer's memory.<br>
		• Every variable has a name, a type and a value.<br>
		• When a value is placed in a memory location, the value replaces the previous value in that location.<br>
		• When a value is read out of a memory location, the process is nondestructive.</p><br>
		<p>Arithmetic<br>
		The basic arithmetic operators (+, -, * , /, and %) are binary operators, because they each operate on two operands. JavaScript provides the remainder operator, %, which yields the remainder after division<br>
		Arithmetic expressions in JavaScript must be written in straight-line form to facilitate entering programs into the computer.</p>
