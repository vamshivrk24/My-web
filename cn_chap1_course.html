		<h2>INTRODUCING NETWORKS</h2>

      <p><br><br>
	•	Definition of <b>Computer Network</b><br>
		Computer network or simply network refers to the connection of two or more computers by some type of medium.<br>
	•	Computer networks allows:<br>
		The transfer of files, data, and even shared applications without copying anything to floppy disk.
		<br>Computers to share items such as printers, scanners, fax machines, processors, disk drives, and other resources.
	<br>Networking Terminology:<br>
	•	Media:<br>
		Refers to the wire cabling that form the connections in most networks.<br>
		Some networks use wireless transmission media, such as infra-red or radio signals.<br>
	•	Client/server networks:<br>
		<b>Servers</b> host the resources for the clients to use and provide security.<br>
		A <b>client</b> is the computer that requests resources from the server.<br>
	•	Peer-to-peer network:<br>
		When every computer on a network acts as both a client and a server. Also known as “workgroups”.<br>
	•	LAN, WAN, MAN, SAN:
		<b>Local area network (LAN)</b>is contained within a company or department and located in a single geographic area.<br>
		<b>Wide area network (WAN)</b> spans multiple geographic areas and is usually connected by common telecommunication carriers.<br>
		<b>Metropolitan area network (MAN)</b> refers to the intermediate stage between a LAN and a WAN.<br>
		<b>Storage area network (SAN)</b> refers to a series of storage devices that are networked together to provide very fast data storage for a network or subnetwork.<br>
	•	Network Operating System (NOS):<br>
		Allows communication, security, and distribution of data, files, and applications over a network.<br>
	•	Network Interface Card (NIC):<br>
		A device that allows a computer or other device to connect to a network through the media.<br>
	•	Networking hardware:<br>
		Describes all the physical components of a network, such as the NIC, cable, hub, switch, router, and any related connectors or devices.<br>
	•	Networking software:<br>
		The programs used to run a network.<br>
	•	Virtual private networks:<br>
		Network that uses a public communications infrastructure (like the Internet) to facilitate private communication between a company LAN and remote employees.<br>
		<b>Extranet</b> is the part of the company’s network that allows access to non-employees.<br>
		<b>Intranet</b> is the part of the company’s network that allows access to employees.<br>
	Advantages of Layering:<br>
	Simplifies the networking model<br>
	Enables programmers to specialize in a particular level or layer<br>
	Provides design modularity<br>
	Encourages interoperability<br>
	Allows networking vendors to produce standardized interfaces<br>
	•	Protocol:<br>
	Defined method for communicating between systems. Computers must use a common protocol to communicate properly.<br>
	Examples: TCP/IP and IPX/SPX<br>
	<p><img src = "images/osi-table.jpg" title="OSI-Model"></p>
	<br>When the network user sends data to the network, it goes through a five-step data encapsulation process.<br>
